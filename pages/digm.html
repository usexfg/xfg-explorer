<label style="font-family:Lato;"><span style="font-size:medium;color: aliceblue;">DIGM is a music revolution via platform (or hosting framework) integration with the Fango peer-to-peer network,
whereby Elder Nodes serve catalogued music to Fango GUI wallets using their remote service connections. Allowing for any independent artist to upload &amp; sell their own audio or music album(s) - and keep 100% of revenue earned.</span>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;color: aliceblue;">Also by default, we plan to offer a P2P streaming rewards radio (Paradio) using singles submitted by artists from album(s) available for sale in DIGM marketplace. Both artist &amp; listener receive rewards in <a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/PARA-GCFWKV4KWYPBPQVQYLVL6N6VARBLVQS6POYEMLN7AGZB5UK4VIJX565U-1?filter=trustlines" target="_blank">PARA</a> for streaming radio airtime.</p>

<p style="color: aliceblue;">Prototype will be reserved for Desktop (Fango-Wallet) as we have discussed making hashpower toward the Fango network a simple requirement for freemium access, or possibly for track-specific plays/skips.
Diverting special purpose hashpower provided by platform listeners would open up a number of economic possibilities.
For example, any Fango blocks mined from this special purpose hashpower would serve as a ‘proof of listener’ and be used to pay DIGM artists an additional distribution % according to number of streams/plays during each 30 day cycle in either XFG or <a href="https://simpleledger.info/token/8261c44c396fb1120b699b10de708f37a72f8b0339752d4dba67e193dbf898eb">DIGM</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 33px;color: aliceblue;">Marketplace payment for albums will naturally be on-chain &amp; exclusive to XFG by using built-in (fango) public addresses (Elder Node service address) for each hosting node operated by the individual artist, service provider, or even a label of artists*.</p>

<p>Both DIGM &amp; PARA tokens are offered initially for crowdfunding development of ParaDio+ and DIGM Audio Marketplace- however, as the platform becomes operational, DIGM tokens are required each cycle in order to host/share/sell audio in the marketplace. By having <b>100,000 DIGM</b> (no decimals) as a maximum, there will always be a limited number of artists (or hosts) able to sell music on the platform at any given time.
 PARA tokens are also limited in supply to one (1) token per issuing platform, (1 of 2 available:<a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/PARA-GCFWKV4KWYPBPQVQYLVL6N6VARBLVQS6POYEMLN7AGZB5UK4VIJX565U-1?filter=trustlines"> Para-on-Stellar</a>) which are denominated in sub-decimal pico-PARA (10^12) or just "para", and will be used for streaming airtime rewards to both artist & listener. </p>
<sup style="font-family:Roboto;">(*) DIGM hosting Elder Nodes would be able to function as an 'artist pool'
(think mix between record label and mining pool) being able to host content for- and distribute streaming royalties to- a roster of different artists. </sup>
